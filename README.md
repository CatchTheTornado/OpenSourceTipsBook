## How to contribute

This book is published in the form of a Node.js (Astro) webpage. If you're thinking of adding or tweaking some content you might want to first check if there's already an [issue for it](https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/opensourcetipsbook/issues) (If not create one to avoid the duplication of your work) or maybe even a ready [pull request](https://github.com/CatchTheTornado/opensourcetipsbook/pulls) waiting to be merged. 

Then - the best way to contribute is one of the following two. 

### Install and test the website locally
